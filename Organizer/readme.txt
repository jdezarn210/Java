This java code takes a txt file with the format of :
'variable, variable, variable' 
and determines which variable is a string, a float, or an int.
It then produces a txt file that specifies those variables.
It also removes any white space if there is any and separates them through ','
for example: if the file had 'hello, 1.50, 1'
the output in the new txt file will be 'String, Float, Integer'
